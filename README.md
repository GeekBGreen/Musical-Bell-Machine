Muscial Bell Machine
====================

This is a project that I created with my child over the christmas holiday 2015. This is a machine that uses a Raspberry Pi (programmed using Python) to control actuators that strike bells tuned to the major scale to play music. The machine has 8 bells total, covering one whole octave. The first song we enabled it to play is Joy To The World.

The source code was created to enable the reading of files that contain the song information. This way, the song doesn't have to be hard coded into the logic, and a song can be loaded to be played simply. Please look at the file BellAndNoteKey.txt as well as our Joy To The World example in the songs folder to understand the song file format (.bel) and begin creating songs of your own!

Future Features/Changes:
- Add more songs!
- Enable use to add bpm in the command line

To do list:
- Clean up comments in code
